            "\n",
            "### 1. `for` Loop\n",
            "The `for` loop is ideal for iterating over elements in a collection, like a list, tuple, or string.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of using a for loop\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "**Best Practices:**\n",
            "- Use meaningful variable names to improve readability.\n",
            "- Leverage the `enumerate` function if you need both index and value.\n",
            "  \n",
            "```python\n",
            "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
            "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. `while` Loop\n",
            "The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known ahead of time and depends on some condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a while loop\n",

            "You can control the flow of loops using `break` and `continue`.\n",

            "```python\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",

            "- Use `break` and `continue` sparingly to avoid making the logic complex.\n",
            "- Document the purpose if it’s not immediately clear why these are used.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. List Comprehensions\n",
            "For cases where you can generate a new list based on an existing one, consider using list comprehensions instead of loops for cleaner and more efficient code.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a list comprehension\n",
            "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",

            "- Use comprehensions for simple transformations; avoid them for complex logic that reduces readability.\n",

This issue is exemplified by the case of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who struggled to manage ABC after acquiring it, despite his prior success in the TV network industry. Eisner's assertion that he could improve ABC if he had more time highlights the problem of transitioning from being an excellent operator in a specific role to managing the broader organization effectively. This situation can occur when leaders find it difficult to let go of the function they once excelled in, leading to suboptimal hiring decisions in those areas.\n",
