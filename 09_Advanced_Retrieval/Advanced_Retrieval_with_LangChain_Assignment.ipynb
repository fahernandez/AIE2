For example, some reported that even after years of payments, their balances remained high due to ongoing interest.\\n\\n2. **Financial hardships and employment issues:** Borrowers faced financial hardships, including unemployment, stagnating wages, or unexpected expenses, making it impossible to afford repayment or increasing their reliance on forbearance, which can lead to higher accruing interest.\\n\\n3. **Lack of clear communication and mismanagement:** Several complaints highlighted a lack of proper notification about loan transfers, repayment start dates, or delinquency statuses. Some borrowers weren't informed when payments had resumed or when their loans were transferred without their knowledge, leading to missed payments and credit reporting issues.\\n\\n4. **Inability to qualify for forgiveness programs:** Many borrowers did not qualify for loan forgiveness programs like PSLF or TLF, which contributed to prolonged, unmanageable debt.\\n\\n5. **Problems with payment application and servicer practices:** Some reported that their additional payments were not applied to the principal and most went toward interest, prolonging the repayment period and increasing total debt.\\n\\n6. **Administrative errors and technical issues:** Complaints included errors such as incorrect reporting of late payments, failure to notify about delinquencies, or mishandling of account information, which negatively impacted credit scores and repayment ability.\\n\\nOverall, a combination of high interest, insufficient income, lack of transparent communication, and administrative issues contributed to people struggling to repay their loans.\""

Users may ask ambiguous or incomplete questions, or use terminology that differs from the language in your documents. By generating multiple reformulations of a user query, you increase the chances that at least one version will closely match the relevant information in your data. This approach helps surface more relevant documents that might otherwise be missed, thereby improving recall and ensuring the system retrieves a broader and more accurate set of results for the user's true intent."
